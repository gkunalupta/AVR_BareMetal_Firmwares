# AVR_BareMetal_Firmwares
Embedded C and Register level Coding for all peripherals of AVR UART, I2C, SPI, GPIO, TIMERS, ADC, Interrupts.
Firmware Development of Various Application Code for All Peripherals from scratch and Bare Metal
Like 
UART Application Code --> ESP8266 AT Commands Firmware From UART Device driver(ring buffer)

SPI Application Code --> W25q128JV, NRF24L01 Firmware from SPI Device Driver

I2C Application Code --> RTC3231, LCD_I2C firmware from I2C Device Driver

ADC Application Codes --> LDR,LM32,Potientiomter, Joystick Firmware from ADC Device Driver

Timers Application Codes --> PWM, Input capture, RGB lights, Motor Drivers,DHT11 sensor Firwares from Various Timer Device Drivers

GPIO Application Codes --> Keypad(419), LCD screen, internal PushPull resistor and various other Firmware From GPIO device driver

External Interrupt --> Counter, Menu based codes


Also 5 bare metal Projects whose Firmware are written from scratch using above device drivers and Application Codes
